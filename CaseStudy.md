### Research
#### Studio Roosegaarde

*Light*  
-All of Studio Roosegarde’s projects involve the element of light. 
-Light is used as a reactive element to the user’s interaction such as Glowing Nature where hands movements cause the microorganisms to glow or just serve as a secondary component such as in Windvogel, a kite that generates energy. 
  -In Glowing Nature, the experience is used to show the connection between biology and technology.  
  -In Windvogel, the light’s purpose is just to make the kite’s cable visible. 
-Studio Roosegarde mainly focuses on visual response in relation to human interaction. 

*Referencing Nature*
Glowing Nature
![img](https://github.com/yoyomomo/EngM_IOE_Proj3/blob/main/ioe_proj3/img1.png)
-An interactive experience with light emitting algae
-It shows the ties between biology and technology
-Interactive based on movement 
-Environmentally friendly
-It shows the poetic side of nature
-It seems like its more beneficial to display in a dark room

*Van Gogh Path*

-A bicycle path that emits light which glows at night. 
-Interactive and innovative
-It was inspired by “Starry Night”.
-It is a part of the “Smart Highway” Project
-Creates a safe environment for lone cyclists at night
-Ideal for public space displays

*Lotus Dome*

-Interactive project using light and temperature.
-Each flower petal on the Lotus Dome is heat sensitive allowing it to react to human interaction.
-The light from the dome also follows whoever is around it. 
-This design uses sensory stimulus and light manipulation in a public space to create dynamic and interactive designs.

*Smart Highways*

-Sustainable lit up roads
  -Glowing lines that light up at night for approximately 8 hours
  -The paint charges during the day
-Makes the driving experience more memorable
-Increases safety at night
-Many fall asleep or lose focus at the wheel when driving at night
-This project reimagines the driving experience at night by having the lines serve an artistic purpose as well as informational

*Takeaways*
-Social commentary in the realm of nature or sustainable living
-Integrating elements of light within our projects
  -Light as a reactive component
  -Light as a supporting component
-Light providing information while also serving an artistic purpose
-Using nature and space as a way to create an interactive and evocative experience.
-There is a strong connection between nature and technology.
