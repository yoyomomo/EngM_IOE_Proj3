## Design Statement
The main goal of the project was to create a product or installation that could possibly be created by yourself or a team. Using a series of different techniques such as brainstorming, body storming, and using a design matrix the project explored many different ways to come up with a product or installation. Many other products were brainstormed such as a proximity LED mirror and a social distancing wearable. However, while branching off from the idea of social distancing and light the idea of a public space installation was brainstormed. The main product created for this project was a social distancing ring, the DistancRing. Which would mainly be used in high traffic areas such as grocery stores where social distancing rules are necessary. However, because of the pandemic workshopping and labs aren’t available, so the project was mainly worked on with limited materials, and creating mockups that could be shown to possible “investors” that the project could be made a reality.

## Users & Audience
The users and audience of this product are for people that mainly go outside to grocery stores or other necessary places. This makes the audience pool very wide, but due to the nature of the pandemic, different kinds of users’ need to be taken into account. 

## Scope & Constraints
Due to the pandemic, the main constraints were not being able to use the labs to workshop proper prototypes. This also meant not being able to go out to get proper materials if they were needed. Another special constraint was time limit, due to it being the end of the semester last-minute ordering of needed products wasn’t an option since they would not arrive fast enough. 

## Research
### Studio Roosegaarde
*Light*  
-All of Studio Roosegarde’s projects involve the element of light.<br/>
-Light is used as a reactive element to the user’s interaction such as Glowing Nature where hands movements cause the microorganisms to glow or just serve as a secondary component such as in Windvogel, a kite that generates energy.<br/>
  -In Glowing Nature, the experience is used to show the connection between biology and technology.<br/>
  -In Windvogel, the light’s purpose is just to make the kite’s cable visible.<br/>
-Studio Roosegarde mainly focuses on visual response in relation to human interaction.

-There is a strong connection between nature and technology.<br/>


## Prototypes and Ideas
While brainstorming for the project thumbnail sketches were created to help visualize possible designs. Using a design matrix to fully understand how the project could work in what space and using what materials, possible mockups and prototypes were created. 

## Design Matrix
While using the design matrix to fully understand the project multiple things we’re noticed and noted. Despite all 3 brainstormed concepts being completely different they all had the same proximity property in common. The concepts also involved with public space or human interaction in general. Lastly, the concepts all involved some property of light to them.

Mockup

For this sketch, the main idea was to create a type of mirror that also used LEDs and possibly proximity. It would be a public installation that would promote safety at night. The prototype is mainly inspired by several designs from Studio Roosegaarde, which our group did a case study on. The studio had a project called the Van Gogh Path which showed a very organic lit pathway at night. The prototype shown here goes for less organic and more structural. Using them in alleyways that are usually dimly lit and seen as dangerous areas could become somewhere safer. The project would react like a mirror and follow whoever was in front of the structure while also increasing or decreasing in brightness depending on their proximity.

The main idea of this sketch was to use the current situation with COVID19 and make a wearable that would aid in social distancing. The wearable was inspired by using conductive paint on cloth material. It was noted during the use of the conductive paint there was a proximity property to it as well. Although the range wasn’t large, when a hand was in the vicinity of the object it would switch on a light. The same concept would be applied to this wearable prototype. Utilizing proximity, LEDs, and other possible safe conductive materials a wearable, customizable patch could be created. The patch would detect if people were within a certain distance of the user the colour of the LED would change which would visually notify the user and people around them that someone has gotten to close to them.

The idea behind this sketch was to create also a concept around COVID19 and the issues related to social distancing. Specifically, social distancing in public places like grocery stores. The concept of the project was to create an interactive system for each person in the grocery store. This could mean either implementing the tech into the floor itself, have it projected from the ceiling, or have it projected from simple objects like grocery baskets or carts. The projected circular border would allow patrons to properly social distance and if there was a moment where they couldn’t the border would change its colour.

*Flashlight Prototype*

### Video
[Flashlight Experimentation Video](https://youtu.be/DQlSCTV57ZM)
To test the possible ways the social distancing ring would work different methods were discussed. However, due to a lack of materials improvising was needed. So, to create and mimic the effect of a projected ring a flashlight was used. The flashlight had the centre of it covered up with a sheet of paper. Initially, when it was first tried out with plain white paper it was observed that there was still a light in the centre of the ring. Assuming it was the paper just being too thin black paint was applied to the paper as well to block out any light that might be coming through. However, after testing the flashlight again it was noticed that there was a mirror inside of the flashlight causing the light to reflect in the middle despite being covered up.

*Creating in After Effects*

[Basket Prototype Video](https://youtu.be/ZmqLIr8ktWs)
To create a convincing prototype After Effects was used to give the illusion of the project being real. After creating different kinds of mockups in Photoshop, the project was moved into After Effects, using self-filmed footage of walking through a simple hallway. An initial video was created where the effect of the ring on the ground is very rough, choppy, and not properly following. After taking some time to slowly edit key points and making the effects of the ring moving and changing size, the final video was created. 

## DistancRing
The DistancRing is mainly to be used in high traffic areas such as grocery stores. Many people who go to grocery stores try their best to keep their distance from other people, but sometimes it might just not be possible, or there are some people who don’t wish to follow social distancing rules. The DistancRing is the solution to that issue. Equipped to any grocery store basket or cart and it will create a light ring that will allow the user to safely social distance. In times where users’ rings might get too close or overlap the colour of the ring will change allowing the users to have a visual cue as to what has happened. 

## Outcomes & Results
In the end, a video showcasing the possibility of a new COVID19 social distancing product was created. The main hurdle for the creation of the project was figuring out a way to create the product with limited time and limited resources. Some of the main lessons learned throughout this project were how to improvise and show a product even if it wasn’t possible to build at that moment. Another lesson learned was to take time to step away from projects. Using After Effects to have the ring look like it was following a moving person was a slight challenge due to being inexperienced but taking time with the project allowed a lot of learning and growing.
